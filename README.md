Every modern phone has a camera that is a potential barcode reader, capable to read the [European Article Number](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Article_Number)

But EAN databases are either expensive or incomplete.

With an [Amazon Associate Account](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) (free if you you have a website that advertises products for Amazon) you can access the [Amazon Product Advertising API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/Welcome.html) and get at least a title and a description to kickstart your own database!

So basically this is a Spring REST example on how to use Amazons API
